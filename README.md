# Fake-Instagram-Account-Detection
Using Data Analysis to find fake instagram accounts.
Introduction:
Social Media has had a great influence on people's lives in recent years. Various apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram are being used by a vast majority of people. Instagram has become an application found on almost every personâ€™s especially on every teenages mobile phone and is used for sharing thoughts, memories, personal moments and more and more new users are joining every day. It is estimated that Instagram has over 1.074 billion users. With this increasing user base people have started creating fake profiles and stalking genuine users, spreading hate, scamming genuine users, etc. Detecting fake accounts can help in preventing such crimes and requests from any such accounts can be blocked so that people can share their thoughts freely. So this project aims to create a model from real fetched data to detect fake accounts on instagram using information that is easily available to the user. I have used the XGBoost classifier on my fetched dataset to obtain a model with around 96% accuracy.
